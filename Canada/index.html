		<h3 class="white" > The Palaeoindians </h3>
        <p class="white"> The first humans to arrive in Canada were prehistoric humans who arrived<br>
		in northwestern Yukon over 12 000 years ago. They crossed a land bridge which<br> 
		connected Siberia with Alaska and modern day Canada. Eventually, they spread<br>
        all across North America. These people were known as the Palaeoindians. They<br> 
        were considered Indiginous peoples. Back then, Canada was still covered in<br> 
        huge ice sheets. The palaeoindians ate and hunted caribou, and muskoxen among<br>
        other animals. They also fished, and hunted small game to support themselves<br>
        By 10 000 years ago, they habited most of Canada. The Indiginous people created<br> 
        their own society and customs. Indiginous art was discovered in various places<br>
        dating back to around 2000-3000 years ago. Around the same time, evidence of<br>
        farming was also discovered. </p>

		<h3 class="white">European Arrival</h3>
		<p class="white"> The discovery of Canada by the europeans started in the 16th<br> century. A French explorer named Jacques Cartier travelled across the Atlantic Ocean<br> in search for new land for the King. He landed near what is now Gaspe, Quebec.<br> 
		Cartier was excited, but failed to create a permanent settlement. In 1603, a<br>
		person named Samuel de Champlain founded a colony in Canada known as New France<br>
		that resided along the St. Lawrence river. He created many notable cities that<br>
		still exist today, including Quebec City and Port-Royal. Samuel de Champlain was<br> 
		one of the most important people in shaping Canada. The government of France created<br>
		the establishment of Montreal which is still one of the most important cities in <br>
		Canada today. The British landed in North America near the same time as Champlain <br>
		did. They created settlements along the east coast of what is now the US. The<br>
		British and the French were both very competitive and determined to claim new land.<br> 
		One of the most significant economical industries was the Fur Trade. Animals<br>
        (especially beavers) were killed, and their pelts were sent back to Europe to be <br>
        made into clothing. There was a lot of competition between the nations as to who had<br> more control over the industry. By the 18th century, tensions were really high. The<br> 
		Seven Years War started in 1756 as a result of worsenting relations between France<br>
		and England. The war was won by England, and most of France's territory was given to<br> England. However, the England turned New France into a British Colony named <br>
		Quebec, which operated under the Quebec Act, which preserved French Culture. </p>

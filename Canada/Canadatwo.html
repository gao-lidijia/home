	   <h2 class="white">How has Canada changed</h2>
        <p class="white"> Since Canada was founded in 1867, it has undergone<br>
		many changes both physically, and politically. In 1867, the population <br>was just
		over 3 million but now, the population is close to 40 million. <br>
		Canada has also become one of the most diverse countries in the world.<br> 
		in 1913, almost half a million people immigrated to Canada. Nowadays, almost 300<br>
		000 people immigrate to Canada each year. About 1 in 5 people in Canada<br>
		were born in another country. The population has also become much<br> 
		more urban, with over 80% of people living in urban residences.  </p>

        <p>One major occurence that changed Canada was the Industrial  Revolution.<br>
		Due to this, Canada experienced a huge growth in factory work and <br>
		industrialisation. In the early 20th century, a huge number of immigrants<br>
		arrived in Canada, broadening the ethnic makeup.After World War II, Canada<br>
		experienced an economic boom. The discovery of oil in Alberta made Canada<br>
		a leading petroleum producer. Canada was also one of the most important in<br>
		industries such as car-building and chemical processing. Since the confederation,<br>
		Canada has gained a few new provinces, such as Saskatchewan and Nunavut.</p>
